What is the mean and standard deviation of sepal length in the Iris dataset?
What are the average petal lengths for each species in the Iris dataset?
Classify this sample: sepal length 6.1, sepal width 2.8, petal length 4.7, petal width 1.2.
What would happen to the classification if we increased petal width by 0.5 cm?
Which two species are most similar based on sepal dimensions?
How accurate is the current KNN model on the test data?
What features influenced the decision the most in this case?
Explain why petal length is more important than sepal width for distinguishing species.
Give me a list of mean values for each feature — as a compact table.
Answer this in under 50 words: which feature is most useful for classification and why?
What would happen if petal length and width were swapped in all samples? Would accuracy increase or decrease?
What's the overall accuracy of the model? Just the number.
How would the classification change if petal length was increased by 2 cm while all other features remained the same?
If a flower is classified as Setosa, what are the most common sepal and petal dimensions for this class? What does that imply about its placement in feature space?
Tell me which sample in the dataset is hardest to classify, and explain why it’s ambiguous.
