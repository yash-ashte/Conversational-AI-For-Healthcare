Q: How well does the model classify flowers?

ChatGpt: First, to determine how well the model classifies flowers, we need to assess the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of the model. These metrics give information about the performance of the model in terms of how many predictions it got right (accuracy), how many positive identifications were actually correct (precision), how many actual positives were identified correctly (recall), and a balance between precision and recall (F1 score).

ChatGpt: The model classifies flowers very well. It has an accuracy of 95.33%, which means it correctly predicts the class of the flower 95.33% of the time. The precision and recall are also similarly high at around 95%, indicating the model is reliable in its predictions. The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is also 95.33%, showing that the model has a good balance between the precision and the recall.
