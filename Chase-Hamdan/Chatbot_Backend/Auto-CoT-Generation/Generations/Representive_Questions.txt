Can we improve accuracy with feature engineering?
Can I see the dataset itself?
Is a high F1 score always good?
How does the dataset size affect KNN?
How well does the model classify flowers?
Can you explain what a recall score means in this context?
What’s the easiest way to visualize feature importance?
Can you give me the precision of the model?
